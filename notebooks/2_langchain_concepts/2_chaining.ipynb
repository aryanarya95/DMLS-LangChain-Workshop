    "# **LangChain Chaining: Concepts and Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**\n",
    "Chaining in LangChain allows for the **sequencing of multiple operations**, enabling more complex and structured \\\n",
    "interactions with language models. By combining different processing steps, you can build advanced workflows \\\n",
    "that enhance prompt flexibility and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will cover key **chaining concepts**, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Chaining** â€“ Linking multiple calls together in sequence.  \n",
    "- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** â€“ A structured way to define chains.  \n",
    "- **Understanding Runnables** â€“ The core building blocks for executing chains.  \n",
    "- **Extended Processing** â€“ Transforming and structuring responses dynamically.  \n",
    "- **Parallel Processing** â€“ Running multiple operations simultaneously for efficiency.  \n",
    "- **Branching Processing** â€“ Handling multiple decision paths based on input conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each section includes **clear examples** to demonstrate how chains can be applied in real-world scenarios. ðŸš€"
